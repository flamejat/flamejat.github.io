 ROOT1 is an open-source, cross-platform, object-oriented C++ framework for data analysis, conceived for the practice of High Energy Physics (HEP). Starting as a private project by Rene Brun and Fons Rademakers, ROOT has been at the heart of most HEP analyses during more than two decades, in continuous development and improvement, being in constant communication with the community, obtaining invaluable feedback, providing great toolkit support, and evolving the product according to the needs of its userbase.</description>
