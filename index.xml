      <title>Open Source Firmware Conference 2019 Report</title>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s Open Source Firmware Conference will kick off in little more than two weeks, and I never got myself to write up the report of last year&amp;rsquo;s.
However, I did present about it in a section meeting. These are the supporting slides:

      <title>Analysis benchmarks for grid and HPC</title>

      <description>Initial description for the Openlab Student project proposed for the summer of 2020 that I supervised.
To be updated with the student report and probably a paper once they are available.
Project description CERN measures the performance of computers based on typical computing patterns that happen &amp;ldquo;in real life&amp;rdquo;. One such pattern is analysis. This project proposes to extract existing example analyses to create a benchmarking utility for computers or HPC systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating nvme-cli new feature logs and the need to monitor them</title>
      <link>http://xvallspl.github.io/blog/cern/nvme-cli/</link>

      <description>NVMe is a new, wider, standarized protocol to access flash-based storage over PCIe interfaces. NVMe introduces a new command set, several new concepts, new operations and different or more standarized logging capabilities from the habitual ones on SAS or SATA devices, together with a cli tool, nvme-cli, exposing a human friendly interface to the device.
We take a look at the new logging capabilities to asses if the current monitoring infrastructure in place at CERN, using smartmontools, is enough or if we have a need for the new capabilities interfaced by nvme-cli.</description>

      <title>Improving configuration and monitoring of Nvidia GPU servers at CERN</title>

      <description>One of Techlab&amp;rsquo;s main activities, arguably the most popular one, is the provisioning of GPU resources. In addition to user support, this process involves the complete configuration, administration, lifetime management and maintenance of the systems. Due to the high demand, turnover rate and variety of configurations according to user needs, the existence of an efficient and effective system to handle the configuration and monitoring of GPU resources is fundamental in order to minimize the time cost and to anticipate and investigate potential problems or performance concerns.</description>

      <title>Automatization of Techlab&#39;s Request Management Process</title>

      <description>Warning   This is an old post, Techlab was an interesting project that, unfortunately, no longer exist.
  Background on Techlab, from the website   Techlab is a CERN IT project providing testing/benchmarking platforms for multiple architectures and accelerators. We gather users requests, analyze market trends and procure cutting edge hardware. We then set it up, test it and put it up for experimental use by members of the HEP community.</description>

      <title>ROOT</title>

      <description>This article is part of a series that I&#39;m slowly publishing, and it still has several broken links referencing unpublished articles.
 ROOT1 is an open-source, cross-platform, object-oriented C++ framework for data analysis, conceived for the practice of High Energy Physics (HEP). Starting as a private project by Rene Brun and Fons Rademakers, ROOT has been at the heart of most HEP analyses during more than two decades, in continuous development and improvement, being in constant communication with the community, obtaining invaluable feedback, providing great toolkit support, and evolving the product according to the needs of its userbase.</description>

      <title>Physics analysis in the LHC era</title>
      <link>http://xvallspl.github.io/blog/cern/analysischain/</link>

      <description>This article was originally within a longer text dedicated to ROOT, hence the references to it. I wrote this a while ago and some numbers, for instance the amount of data processed, might be outdated. The LHC is a circular particle accelerator located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and one of the most sophisticated machines ever built by humanity. In order to recreate conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang, the LHC circulates a beam of charged particles over its 27 km of circumference, increasing their momentum until they reach the appropriate energy, and then collides them at one of the 4 particle detectors in its ring: A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE), A Toroidal LHC Apparatus (ATLAS), Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb).</description>
